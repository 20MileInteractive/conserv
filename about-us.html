				<p>Founded in 1993, ConServ Group is a dedicated <strong>Builder – Architect</strong> striving to make its first priority customer satisfaction.  ConServ has a long and successful history of substantial projects in Southern New England and Cape Cod.  We work closely with our clients to create a facility which meets the highest quality standards within the established budget and schedule parameters.</p>

				<h2>The Design-Build Advantage</h2>
				<p>The Design-Build process that ConServ employs is a highly efficient and cost effective method for executing the construction process.  In fact, many of ConServ’s most recent projects have been completed well below their original budgets.  Our transparent, open book accounting process ensures that our customers see all costs associated with their project.  ConServ Clients have complete access and control over the accounting process which eliminates the concerns associated with a general contractor cutting corners to increase profits.  That is, no change orders!  With ConServ, the entire project is managed on a pre-determined fee structure with a <strong>Guaranteed Maximum Price</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>This is a departure from the traditional General Contractor bid process in that there is no need to bid the project out to multiple entities to get the best price.  The open book process ensures you see what we see…all project related costs.  There is no incentive for add-ons and change orders and the end result is a TEAM effort to complete your project in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible.</p>
